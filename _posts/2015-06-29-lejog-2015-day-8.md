So we had basically stayed in the automated premier inn of the
north. Keycards grabbed from the pub at the other end of the car
park. Luckily they let us lock up the bikes in the laundry room (quite a
worry navigating dirty bikes around piles of white linen). Anyway, breakfast
started with a cloying Lidl mayonnaise (with a hint of pasta) meal. Fun
start to the day, which was always planned as the longest. Brain was
elsewhere when we got on the road (took a wrong turning on the 2nd
roundabout), but eventually got into the groove. The legs were noticeably
taking more miles to warm up than at the start of the trip.

Ended up spending a lot of time on the route 7 cycle ways. Crazy how it
varied between a dirt path, packed small stones, tarmac and concrete. We had
to bail on it a few times since the busy road was a better choice when it
was a mud bath. However, annoyingly the main road was pretty rough in
places, pretty hilly corners and lots of holiday traffic/lorries. A bit
annoying having to choose between slow, quiet progress on the cycle path or
faster, busy progress on the road.

Despite the constant flip-flopping, the first half of the distance went by
fast although a little soul destroying in places. However, bad luck struck
again around the 60mile point. James had his 3rd puncture. Depressingly we
were under plant/tree cover so was extremely humid and became a banquet for
a swarm of peckish midges. With the mood thoroughly low, we got back on the
move before shortly pulling into a hotel restaurant for some lunch. I wont
deny that the thought of calling it a day and staying at the hotel was
extremely tempting. On later reflection it was a good thing I kept quiet on
the subject since James would have readily buckled to stopping as well.

Second half of the ride started off better. Ended up having 3 long climbs
followed by fun descents. The body was pretty destroyed after the cumulative
climbs but it felt good to conquer each one in turn. Unfortunately it was a
day that felt like it would never end. We rolled into the youth hostel at
the latest time on our whole trip (doubly depressing after starting so
early). Thankfully the chef was a legend. They had stopped serving but he
sorted out some grub for us. Best comment from him: "I won't tell you about
the salads. it's all rabbit food and you guys won't want that
anyway". Legend!
