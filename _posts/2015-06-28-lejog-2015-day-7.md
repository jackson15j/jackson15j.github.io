Have to put a bit more effort into writing up this day, since I had given up
at the time and just written bullet points under the categories of: "good",
"meh". However, that did summarise the feel of the day. Definitely a day
which felt like it was never going to end.

Good:
-----

- Great full breakfast at the nice farm b&b.
- Beautiful mountain and lake views.
- Brilliant downhills through the mountains.
- Route 7 detour through and past Glasgow.
- Rhubarb crumble at late lunch.
- Saw a jogger that looked like the

Meh:
----

- Lots of on/off rain.
- Second bout of headwind through the open passes.
- Garmin spontaneous power off and issues until track was saved.

Not to bad a day but a bit up and down with the fun and then the meh. We
grabbed some food from a Lidl just north of Glasgow in preparation for the
monster that would be Day 8 (since we knew that it'd be an early start).

Failure stats:
--------------

- Garmin spontaneous power off: 1 (Failed to get gps again until last
  tracking was saved and power cycled (three times before save, once
  afterwards).
- Livetrack connection issues: 4 (think it's a "feature" to disconnect
  livetrack from the garmin side when tracking is paused for to long
  (~10mins)).
- Garmin Connect app crashed (needed a reinstall to get around it crashing
  immediately on app load).
