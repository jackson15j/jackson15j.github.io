Another early start, with the plan to get food on the way. Which we
did&#x2026; eventually. Ended up climbing up Kendall's pass (hard work on an
empty stomach), pass at least one 16% sign (defaced to: 116%. Nice!). The downhill
on the other side was entirely worth the climb. Utterly amazing! Especially
noteworthy since it was our first proper downhill of the ride (and
thankfully not our last). Several 20% sections and lots of low stone
walled corners to lean into and look over. Followed by a great full
breakfast nearing the bottom of the pass. Was buzzing for ages after that
downhill.

Riding around the lake district after the descent was the icing on the trip
so far. Great hills all around and cool lake views, plus good tree lined
roads. Definitely worth thinking about taking another trip to the area. You
could easily drive up and plot a few days of rides in random directions and
not be disappointed.

<p>
Some more chain gang action got us to our lunch stop super quick. This
unfortunately would be the last part of the day where the southern tailwind
would be beneficial. Post lunch was all hard work. Just before crossing the
Metal Bridge into Scotland, we ended up heading west, into the wind that had
been at our backs the whole way. An endless grind on Roman straight roads in
blistering sunshine was soul sucking. Eventually we found a great farm ice
cream parlour a few miles before Dumfries. Rum &amp; raisin and chocolate for
the win!
</p>

<p>
The final stretch was fairly easy going to the Boreland Farm house (very
nice place! Easily best of the trip so far). Legs had taken a few miles to
warm up and get going each stop, but they were still going well. It seems
like the body &amp; mind were starting to get used to the abuse. Possibly our
super positive attitude was from watching: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt00479143/">Rocky Balboa</a>, in the evening.

<p>
Now for the stats:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Garmin crashes: 0
</li>
<li>LiveTrack connection issues: 3 (plus no signal to start through all of the
lake district)
</li>
</ul>
