Beautiful sunshine put a smile on both our faces. Away went the arm/leg
warmers, gilet and overshoes. Out came the suntan lotion and
sunglasses. Hoping on the bike we were welcomed with a gentle tailwind,
buttery smooth roads and a ever so slight downward slope to the road for the
first 5-10miles. A great way to start the day after the 125mile pain of
yesterday, until the Garmin locked up. It took 4 power cycles and saving of
the current tracking to get gps fix again.

From there on out the majority of the ride was done along route 7 (our
faithful friend since first entering into Scotland). Managed to grind out a
good pace whilst topping up our tans. However, our plans to jump onto the A9
through Inverness was not a good idea. The A9 at that point is a heavily
busy dual carriageway. On the fly checking of the map showed that we could
double back along route 7 before switching to our new friend;
route 1. Unfortunately, due to our constant stop/start map checking we ended
up passing the same lady 3 or 4 times. She was smiling each time, so we must
have come across as "charming" stalkers.

A surprise highlight was a fun, challenging climb and long shallow descent
to enjoy because of one of these detours. By the end of the day we realised
our "shortest" day turened out to be back up to our average daily
amount. Finished pretty fresh despite the heat. Oh, and James is
immature. We stopped at Bonnars Bridge.

Failure Stats:

- Garmin crashes: 1 (4 power cycles and saving the track for it to work
  again).
- LiveTrack connection issues: 3
