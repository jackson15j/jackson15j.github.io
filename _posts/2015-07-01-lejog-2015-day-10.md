Last long day and it started off well. Porridge, full breakfast and a clean
drive train (what more can you ask for). First half of the day was a
scorcher, with a high of 31C (Think this may have been the hotest day on
record in the UK). A strong tail wind helped to drive us forward at a great
clip. We did stop for a section at a Hotel in the middle of nowhere. Sign on
the door said caf√© opened at 11:00am. Garmin was proudly saying
11:02am. Tried the door: locked. Chilled out for 10mins in the shade until
we saw a guy wandering around who worked there. Promised us twice that it'd
be open in a moment, but after wasting 30mins we decided to get back on the
bikes. Eventually found a cafe in the next town (I think it was Tongue)
about 15miles away. Thankfully the cafe was wonderfully cool inside and got
to enjoy a great homemade some nice soup & coronation chicken sandwich plus
several cans of drinks each. Quite a satisfying first half of the day after
gunning through the first 50 miles.

The remainder was harder work. We had some tougher terrain and more sunshine
to cycle through. Life got harder when we turned east to hug the coastline.
Our blissful tailwind turned into a vicious crosswind that also brought the
clouds. From there on out the temperature dropped rapidly and eventually
turned to a short, sharp stint of rain. For the first time since Glasgow we
were seeing other batches of cyclists although we were in our own head down
struggle to do more than a gentile (slightly grimacing) nod. Not the most
fun last 30-40 miles.

At the start of the day we had high optimism to tack on the last 20miles to
John O'groats and complete the adventure. However, after grinding through
head/crosswinds for 40miles we had mad an unspoken decision to stick with
plan A: chill out in Thurso and head to John O'groats tomorrow. It was only
later that we found out that by the time we got to the youth hostel we had
already missed the last bus back from John O'groats.

Failure stats time:

- Garmin crashes: 0
- LiveTrack connection issues: 2
