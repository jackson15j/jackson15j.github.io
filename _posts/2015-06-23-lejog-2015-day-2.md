Bright start with an outlook to be baking hot all day. It took a few miles to
get the legs going and shake out the aches from the first day of riding.
Unfortunately James got puncture number 2 within the first 10-15miles (I can't
remember if puncture number 1 was on Day 1 or Day 2). I patched the old tube,
whilst James replaced it for a spare. The rear tyre looked to be in a sorry
state so used a
[vinyl tyre patch](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/park-tools-emergency-tyre-boot-patch/)
(Thank you 3M/Park Tools) and patched the hole in the tyre. It took a while but
we eventually got back up to speed and was enjoying rolling hills again, were I
got to renew my role as "downhill canary". Faster hubs and less weight meant I
got to enjoy the speed and shout for cars on every blind bend.

After 2 unnecessary hills in Launceston (first bypassing the town and second
hunting for a bike shop at the top of town), we found a pretty good bike shop -
[Launceston Cycles](http://www.launcestoncycles.co.uk). They had moved to the
end of the trading estate (but was apparently up the hill in town). Great
service from the husband & wife, good free coffee, new tyre for James and some
other bits & pieces. Probably spent too long there, but wasn't upset. Shame
we'd only don't about 20 miles by midday.

More rolling hills before knocking up some sandwiches at the top of a Dorset
hill. Then back on the bike before another stop for ice cream, mango juice,
water and Eccles cakes.

Dipped into the V bank twice today. Gunned out 10 miles straight at the
front in the last 40 to keep us moving at a good pace. Then chain ganged the
last 10 into Taunton.

2hrs later than expected and physically/mentally destroyed we finally rolled
into Taunton. Looking back we both agreed we should have stopped for food in
the last 20. A massive pan of pasta helped sort out the evening whilst we
reflected back on how although it was a good day in general.
