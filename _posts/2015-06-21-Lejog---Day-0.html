<p>
Initial ride from Penzance to lands end (<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/330242538">strava link</a>), then off to the youth
hostel. Got lost coming out of the train station and hit a mean hill straight
away.

<p>
Photos at Lands End, and meet a Scot who had driven down from John O'groats
that day. Said he was waiting for a group of 26 to do the downward journey
in 24hrs. I'm sure that's nearly 40mph average :s

<p>
Chinese take away and several pints have put a shine on the short start.
