The initial day was mostly filled with trying to get to the starting
point. Packed the bike in the car and last minute fretting over the kit, before
driving from Cardiff to my mates place in Taunton. After a quick lunch we
headed off for a long 4hour train ride to Penzance. A quick change into bibs in
a disabled toilet before riding in the last of the evening sunshine from
Penzance station to Lands End
[strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/330242538). Annoyingly, we got
lost immediately coming out of the train station and hit a mean hill right
away. Not the nicest way to start a 1000mile journey.

By the time we got to Lands End, the weather was turning a little bit
cloudy. Enjoyed some photos at the Lands End sign post, and meet a Scot who had
driven down from John O'Groats that day. Said he was waiting for a group of 26
to do the downward journey in 24hrs. We checked he was certain that they were
cycling (since I'm sure that's nearly 40mph average :s). To be honest, he
looked like a man that had driven a van since stupid o'clock that morning.

It was a short ride to the Youth Hostel in St Just where we locked the bikes
up, showered and made our way through the woods to the town a few miles
away. Chinese take away and several pints put a shine on the short start.
