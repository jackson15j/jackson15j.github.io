Just a quick 20 mile spin in the sun with a tailwind. A nice morning to
knock out the final miles to, rather than fighting the gloom and crazy
crosswinds of yesterday. Ended up passing a couple who we were talking to on
the train to Inverness later on in the week.

Photos taken. It feels a bit anticlimactic since it wasn't an end after a
long day. Instead it was a gentle ride, some jokes and some downhill racing
before it was all over.

<p>
Quick change at the Seaview hotel toilets and dropped the bikes off to be
couriered home. The first pint after finishing tasted pretty good.

<p>
Now on the bus back to Thurso to unwind and relax properly.

<p>
No Garmin issues today (must be the fear after new Garmin's being announced).
