Just a quick 20 mile spin in the sun with a tailwind. A nice morning to
knock out the final miles to, rather than fighting the gloom and crazy
crosswinds of yesterday. Ended up passing a couple who we were talking to on
the train to Inverness later on in the week.

Photos taken. It feels a bit anticlimactic since it wasn't an end after a
long day. Instead it was a gentle ride, some jokes and some downhill racing
before it was all over.

Quick change at the Seaview hotel toilets and dropped the bikes off to be
couriered home. The first pint after finishing tasted pretty good.

Now on the bus back to Thurso to unwind and relax properly.

No Garmin issues today (must be the fear after new Garmin's being announced).
