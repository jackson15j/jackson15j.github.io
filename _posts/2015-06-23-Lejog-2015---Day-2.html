<p>
Bright start with an outlook to be baking hot all day. It took a few miles
to get the legs going and shake out the aches from the first day of riding.
Unfortunately James got puncture number 2 within the first 10-15miles (I
can't remember if puncture number 1 was on Day 1 or Day 2). I patched the
old tube, whilst James replaced it for a spare. The rear tyre looked to be
in a sorry state so used a <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/park-tools-emergency-tyre-boot-patch/">vinyl tyre patch</a> (Thank you 3M/Park Tools) and
patched the hole in the tyre. It took a while but we eventually got back up
to speed and was enjoying rolling hills again, were I got to renew my role
as "downhill canary". Faster hubs and less weight meant I got to enjoy the
speed and shout for cars on every blind bend.

After 2 unnecessary hills in Launceston (first bypassing the town and second
hunting for a bike shop at the top of town), we found a pretty good bike
shop - <a href="http://www.launcestoncycles.co.uk">Launceston Cycles</a>. They had moved to the end of the trading estate
(but was apparently up the hill in town). Great service from the husband &amp;
wife, good free coffee, new tyre for James and some other bits &amp;
pieces. Probably spent too long there, but wasn't upset. Shame we'd only
don't about 20 miles by midday.

More rolling hills before knocking up some sandwiches at the top of a Dorset
hill. Then back on the bike before another stop for ice cream, mango juice,
water and Eccles cakes.

Dipped into the V bank twice today. Gunned out 10 miles straight at the
front in the last 40 to keep us moving at a good pace. Then chain ganged the
last 10 into Taunton.
</p>

<p>
2hrs later than expected and physically/mentally destroyed we finally rolled
into Taunton. Looking back we both agreed we should have stopped for food in
the last 20. A massive pan of pasta helped sort out the evening whilst we
reflected back on how although it was a good day in general.
