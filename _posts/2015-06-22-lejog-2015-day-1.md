First "proper" day of riding and was thankful that we had grabbed the Lands
End photos yesterday whilst it was sunny. A wet start with the mist giving
visibility to about 20-30m. This and occasional rain meant that much of the
morning was spent in arm/leg warmers & gilet. Quite a good combination which
I felt comfortable in (Although I was cursing my laziness for not washing
the arm/leg warmers in waterproofing solution to build up their old water
resilience). We took a few stops along the ways to get the photos in.

By lunch time we stopped at the miners arms in Milthian. For our first stop,
it was a pretty good score. Nice homely pub feel, entertaining bar staff and
good food. Had a great double burger with blue cheese plus 2 black coffees
(Felt pretty strong after that).

Back on the bikes and the weather had improved. The clouds were parting, and
we were riding into sunny blue skies by the time we got to the ferry
crossing. Body was feeling tired by that point from the many hills
before. Looking back we should have grabbed some food and waited for an hour
for the tide to change so that the main dock would be in use. Instead we
walked over the hill to the low beach. Quite a random experience waiting on
a beach in lycra, no signs around, hoping that you're at the right spot for
a ferry. Luckily it came after 5mins (and double lucky I had just enough
cash to cover the two of us).

As I said before, we should have stopped for food since we were shattered
climbing hills on the far side. Getting to the youth hostel was a godsend by
that point, since the sun was beating down from the ferry ride onwards and
the legs were empty. Looking back over the day the hills weren't too
frequent although a bit steep at times, but in general a real good route.

The youth hostel was pretty interesting. A building at the top of a cliff,
that is hidden by the ridge until you get almost on top of it. Just a mile
or two away from the town (where I had a pretty huge gammon steak for dinner
that night at the local bikers pub).
