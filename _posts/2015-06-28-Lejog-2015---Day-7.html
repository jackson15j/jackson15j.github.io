<p>
Have to put a bit more effort into writing up this day, since I had given up
at the time and just written bullet points under the categories of: "good",
"meh". However, that did summarise the feel of the day. Definitely a day
which felt like it was never going to end.

Good:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

</li>
<li>Brilliant downhills through the mountains.
</li>
<li>Route 7 detour through and past Glasgow.
</li>
<li>Rhubarb crumble at late lunch.
</li>
<li>Saw a jogger that looked like the <a href="https://youtu.be/EDaBD1iLpmk">magician Jen dates in IT Crowd</a>.

<p>
Meh:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lots of on/off rain.
</li>
<li>Second bout of headwind through the open passes.
</li>
<li>Garmin spontaneous power off and issues until track was saved.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not to bad a day but a bit up and down with the fun and then the meh. We
grabbed some food from a Lidl just north of Glasgow in preparation for the
monster that would be Day 8 (since we knew that it'd be an early start).
</p>

<p>
Failure stats:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Garmin spontaneous power off: 1 (Failed to get gps again until last
tracking was saved and power cycled (three times before save, once
afterwards).
</li>
<li>Livetrack connection issues: 4 (think it's a "feature" to disconnect
livetrack from the garmin side when tracking is paused for to long
(~10mins)).
</li>
<li>Garmin Connect app crashed (needed a reinstall to get around it crashing
immediately on app load).
</li>
</ul>
