<li>James Es, who put the idea in my head (and let me be dragged along through
his crazy adventures.
</li>
<li>Christy Boothroyd at <a href="http://slatecycles.co.uk">Slate Cycles</a>, who built me the most amazing bike
ever. No issues along the whole journey, constantly comfortable and
whisper quiet (except when chain needed some tlc).

<li>Friends &amp; Family, who were giving support before/during/after the ride.
