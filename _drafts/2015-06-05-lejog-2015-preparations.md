- James Es, who put the idea in my head (and let me be dragged along through
his crazy adventures.
- Christy Boothroyd at [[http://slatecycles.co.uk][Slate Cycles]], who built me
the most amazing bike ever. No issues along the whole journey, constantly
comfortable and whisper quiet (except when chain needed some tlc).
- Friends & Family, who were giving support before/during/after the ride.
