Been sitting on this write up for a while, but finally managed to find some
time to put it up. Coast2Coast is a pretty good route and was lots of fun
with the Guys & Girls over at Miras IT. Their just giving page is still up if
you want to take a look: https://www.justgiving.com/MirusC2C

Day 1
-----

After a 7 hour, booze filled drive up in a mini bus, day 1 started far too
early. We woke from our sleeping bags before 6 at a farm yard 25 miles from
the coast, grabbed some coffee, pastries & eggs, and hopped back on the mini
bus to the coast.

Obligatory photos and pre-ride faff before we set off at 8 ish with a random
called Neil in tow. I was taking the lead since my garmin was up first, so
kept the pace slow to keep all 16 of is together. It wasn't long before we
got to our first stop back at the barn we crashed in last night.

Second segment we started hitting some gated hills which challenged the
people at the back. We kept waiting for the group to reform to keep it all
together. However, we had our first drop out after this.

Third segment was off road for quite a few miles. Annoyingly I had garmin
crash number one just before. We also lots Pete to the stone path when he
slipped on one of the wet bridges. Snapped derailleur. Trev went back and did
a fixie job with his chain so he could limp to the next stop. Good effort and
great chips.

We started hitting some open countryside and picked up the pace a but more
until the next stop at the halfway point of the hill. We lost Chris due to
cramp, but Pete was back with his ghetto shop fixed derailleur.

The almost last leg was more fun. Lots of hills. Had fun climbing up with
people and challenging Andy and Kev to the top. The final climb of this
section was the best. Lots of switchbacks all the way up. Decided to give it
beans and race to the top (which peaked about 1900ft). Andy was second about
3 mins behind, then Roger, Pete and Hannah 7 mins behind. The downhill wasn't
the steepest but still pretty pacey.

Final climb was a bit of a brick wall. Andy and I were moral support for each
other to get to the top.

Finally at the campsite. Great shower, tiring putting the tent up, fantastic
pub food.

Another day up at 6. Was pretty chilly night so getting up was less than fun
although we had a good breakfast at the pub once the tents had been packed.

Post breakfast the sun had come out and was blazing down. Mood was high until
we had to start with an immediate hill. Most of the morning was spent
regrouping at the top or (sometimes unfortunately) bottom of the hills. Andy
seemed to be on good form so I ended up chasing/buddying up with him on the
climbs, then cooling out on the descents. Was good fun to see everyone
enjoying the long, sweeping descents and enjoying the downhill buzz. Heard
quite a few: "Now I understand why people enjoy cycling".

The climbs before the first stop were pretty good. Had a couple long ones
that were 12-20%. Eventually we climbed out of the tree line and got to enjoy
the beautifully barren hill top landscape with valleys and crevices in the
distance on either side. Great views that you could see for 20-30+ miles
easily.

On our way out of the hills we were back into the rolling countryside. I
moved to the back of the group to help out the stragglers. Building on the
pointers from yesterday to help them climb/descend more comfortably/safely,
as well as getting them to draft me so I could pull them back into the pack.

No major issues out of the hills but a few route changes on the fly that I'll
list quickly:

- Jump off an A road to the cycle path beneath it.
- Building site across cycle path with no diversion.
- Waterside food festival in Newcastle.
- Several more random building sites blocking cycle route access.

Finally got there though with everyone in tact and no one sitting out. Photos
on the beach and then some fantastic fish & chips.
